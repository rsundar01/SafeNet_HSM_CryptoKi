class MiscProviderList {
  /* Description ** This example illustrates - how to conveniently list security providers debugging purposes. There are
   * a multitude of ways a provider can be utilized which can lead to confusion. The methods used in common practice
   * will be illustrated here. Select either Method 1 or Method 2 for loading the Luna Providers. Do not mix the methods
   * together as this will cause undefined behaviour, most likely resulting in a exception being thrown. For more
   * information please see the Security and Provider class definitions in the JDK API documentation for the release of
   * the JDK you are using. NOTE FOR ALL METHODS* No matter which way you load the Luna Providers, you need to import
   * the Luna Provider methods in your source files as is normal for using any 3rd party JARs/Classes in your
   * application. Method 1 ** The easiest way to insert a provider is to place it at the top of the list in the
   * java.security file. For example (this is a snippet from a java.security file) security.provider.1=LunaProvider
   * security.provider.2=sun.security.provider.Sun (etc...) By placing the LunaProvider at the top of this list, it will
   * become the first choice of any provider-dependent classes when searching for a provider. When no provider is
   * specified in a cryptographic call, the class searches through the provider list (starting with the first) to find
   * an implementation of the method. If something is not supported by the top- level providers then a search through
   * the remaining providers is conducted until an appropriate provider is found or an exception is thrown. Method 2 **
   * This method is a completely code-based method of accessing security providers at the cost of adding a little
   * complexity to the application. You will need one of the follow setups at the top of your source file for this to
   * work. import java.security.Provider; import java.security.Security; OR import java.security.*; Before calls can be
   * made to the Luna providers, they have to by added to the list of providers that the JDK loaded. This can be done in
   * one of two ways. // This method appends the Luna Provider to the bottom of the // list Security.addProvider(new
   * LunaProvider()); OR // This method will place the Luna Provider at the top of the // list
   * Security.insertProviderAt(new LunaProvider, 1); Adding the providers to either the beginning or the end of the list
   * needs to be done only once for the life of the invoking application. */
